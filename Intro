Introduction
On September 6, 2007, the Israeli air force raided and destroyed the suspected site of a nuclear reactor at the Dayr ez-Zor region in Northern Syria.  However, as a classified mission, facts regarding the operation remain speculative and unconfirmed.  Among these conjectures is the alleged presence of cyber-means to enable the airstrike.  For the purposes of this paper, I will assume the documented veracity of Operation Orchard.  Further, it is acknowledged that much of the information is questionable or contested by other documented information.  I will first provide a summary of reported events leading up to the strike to provide a framework for the possible cyber-attack.  I shall discuss the theories regarding both operational details and extent of involvement on the part of the various implicated parties.  This will provide context to explain how the Israelis may have utilized cyberspace to achieve operational success, and the implications of such an attack for possible merged operations and for the cyber warfare debate.
